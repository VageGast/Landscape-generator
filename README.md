# Landscape-generator
Python landscape generator using midpoint displacement.

To read an in depth explanation visit this [blog entry](https://bitesofcode.wordpress.com/2016/12/23/landscape-generation-using-midpoint-displacement/).

## TO DO
- ~~Organise and comment the code in ```landscape_generator.py``` file so it is more clear~~
- Let the user play with the parametres of the landscape
- Command line arguments / GUI
- ~~Documentation~~ See the blog post linked above and comments in the code.
- It would be nice to have a tool to preview and organize the selected colors (The obtained classes from the search now implement a method, ```draw()```, which draws the Pattern, Color or Palette it is called on)
